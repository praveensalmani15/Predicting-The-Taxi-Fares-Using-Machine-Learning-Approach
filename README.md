# ðŸš– Predicting Taxi Fares Using Machine Learning
A Regression Analysis

This project aims to build a robust predictive model that estimates taxi fares based on features like trip distance, duration, and traffic-related information. The primary goal is to create an accurate fare estimation model that can help customers and service providers understand fare breakdowns in advance.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Problem Statement: Predict the fare amount for taxi rides using various trip and location-based features.

Target Variable: fare_amount

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
Null Value Handling: Dropped rows where the target variable fare_amount was missing, as these entries cannot be used for supervised learning.

Data Matching: Ensured consistency between the fare_amount and other associated columns like trip_distance, trip_duration, and geolocation variables to avoid misaligned or noisy training data.

Feature Engineering: Created new variables such as:

Distance traveled using pickup and dropoff coordinates

Trip duration

Hour of day and day of week from timestamp data

ðŸ“Š Modeling Techniques
Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

XGBoost Regressor

Among these, Polynomial Regression yielded the best results with:

RÂ² Score: 0.937

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 34.59

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Trip Distance, Trip Duration, and Per Km Rate were among the most influential features.

Fare estimation accuracy increased significantly after applying polynomial features.
